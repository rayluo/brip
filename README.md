# python-project-template
A minimalist template to start a new Python project.


## Usage

1. From github web interface,
   [use this repo as a template](https://github.com/rayluo/python-project-template/generate)
   to start your new project, then you can clone your project into your local machine.
2. `git mv my_package your_prj_name`
3. Modify `setup.cfg` and this `README.md`, possibly also `LICENSE`.
4. Commit your change. You are now ready to work on YOUR project!
5. Optionally, rename `your_prj_name/main_module.py` into your preferred module name.
   If you do so, do not forget to also modify `your_prj_name/__init__.py` accordingly.
